Getting Started
---------------

If you don't already have Android Studio, you can download it <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

Once Android Studio is installed, please get your free ONYX trial-license <a href="http://www.diamondfortress.com/sdk" target="_blank">here</a>. <br />
**Note: Make sure you have updated to the latest Android SDK via the SDK Manager.**

You should receive a trial license of the form XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-X-X at your provided e-mail address.

Next, you can clone our sample repository on the command-line using the following commands 
(alternatively, use a graphical tool of your choice):

    > cd <YOUR_DEVELOPMENT_ROOT>
    > git clone https://github.com/DFTinc/onyx-enroll-wizard-sample-app1.git

Place the trial key into `onyxenrollwizardsampleapp/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` shown below:

    ...
    <string name="onyx_license">XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-X-X</string>
    ...

This sample uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the
"gradlew build" command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.
